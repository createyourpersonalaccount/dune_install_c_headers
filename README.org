#+TITLE: A dune project installing a C library

* Information

** How to build and install

Use the following to build

#+begin_src bash
  dune build -p foo-ocaml,foo
#+end_src

and then from a root shell,

#+begin_src bahs
  opam-installer foo-ocaml.install && opam-installer foo.install
#+end_src

** What files are contained in this repository

We define two packages, ~foo~ and ~foo-ocaml~. The ~foo-ocaml~ package contains an OCaml library ~mylib~ with a single function ~myfunc : bool -> int~. The ~foo~ package uses the C stub mechanism to create an ~.so~ that is linkable from C.
